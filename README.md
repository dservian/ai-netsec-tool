 This tool uses an Isolation Forest algorithm to identify unusual patterns in network traffic. It begins by collecting data and training a model. After that, it continuously monitors the network in real time.

 ## Installation

 1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-netsec-tool.git
    cd ai-netsec-tool
    ```

 2. Install the required packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

 ## Usage

 Run the tool with elevated privileges from the command line:

 ```
 python netsec_tool.py --interface [your_interface_name]
 ```

 Additional options:
 - `--model path/to/model.joblib`: Use a pre-trained model
 - `--save-model path/to/save/model.joblib`: Save the trained model after running
 - `--initial-packets`: Number of packets for the initial training (Default: 10000)
